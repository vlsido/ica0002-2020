## IMPORTANT: Course structure change

We have changed the course structure to follow the university recommendations.

The following info is for **both Tuesday and Wednesday groups**.

Class times:

 - Tuesday 17:15 -- room 219 -- lecture -- video is recorded
 - Tuesday 19:00 -- room 410 -- lab -- video is recorded
 - Wednesday 16:00 -- room 221 -- lab
 - Wednesday 17:45 -- room 319 -- lab

**DO NOT COME TO CLASS IF YOU FEEL SICK! STAY AT HOME!**

This week lecture video is recorded on Tuesdays at 17:15. You can watch it live,
or later any time that is convenient for you.

Lab task is presented on Tuesdays at 19:00. You can watch it live, or later any
time that is convenient for you.

There are 3 lab times available. You can choose any lab time you want, but it's
not required to come to class at all -- you can complete the tasks at home.

On a lab class we answer questions about **previous 2 labs only**. If you have
any questions about older labs (say, question about lab 1 on the week 4) please
use email or GitHub issues. We won't handle these in class.


These rules are efficient since Sep 24, 2020 and until next announcement.
